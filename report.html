			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Does the ownership of the buildings affect their affordability?</li>
				<li>Does the flip term/no-lip status of a property significantly increase its value?</li>
				<li>Do prices increase due to the increasing “luxury status” of the properties?</li>
				<li>...</li>

					As I was initally exploring the dataset, I discovered a couple quirks. For example, while most of the 
					buildings sold are in the city of Boston proper, there a couple from the zip code 02190, which is the 
					town of Weymouth, Massachusetts. In the map above you can clearly see it's distant placement from the 
					rest of the city, which would have implications on many of the properties' attributes. Although the 
					datapoints with this zip code were not many, I made an effort to exclude
					then from the rest of the vizualizations so as not to skew the data.
